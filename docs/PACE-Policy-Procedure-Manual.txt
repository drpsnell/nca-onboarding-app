INTRODUCTION 
The Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards (FCLB), the non-profit 
association of government agencies empowered to regulate the chiropractic 
profession, is pleased to present the FCLB service entitled Providers of 
Approved Continuing Education (PACE).   
The mission of the FCLB is to protect the public and to serve our 
member 
boards 
by 
promoting 
excellence 
in 
chiropractic 
regulation.   
At the request of our membership and major CE providers, the FCLB has 
worked closely with member boards and program stakeholders to develop a 
uniform approval process designed to streamline recognition for providers 
seeking board approval for their CE programs. In addition, PACE offers the 
chiropractic community an efficient mechanism to select their continuing 
education hours with confidence.   
To comply with the legalities of maintaining decision-making authority within 
the regulatory boards, FCLB and its PACE Committee recommend that member 
boards adopt the criteria of PACE as part of the criteria of the board. 
Thereafter, a member board can rely upon the PACE recognition as 
determining compliance with the defined criteria.  Please reference the Model 
Statute and Regulations in Appendix 3. 
Chiropractic regulatory boards may also assess providers and/or programs 
directly to verify compliance with criteria determined by the board. However, 
the FCLB PACE program is designed to provide uniform criteria and to alleviate 
the administrative burdens placed upon boards by this resource-intensive 
process.   
Evaluating applicants and approved CE providers is an ongoing process. Once 
Recognized Provider status is awarded, FCLB continues to assess compliance 
with PACE requirements as a service to its member boards in furtherance of its 
public protection mission.

What Is Pace? 
PACE evaluates providers for program quality in eight areas which include 25 
criteria. Only CE providers that meet the FCLB PACE Criteria for Quality 
Continuing Education and comply with FCLB PACE Policies & Procedures are 
granted PACE approval and are authorized to use the PACE logo and/or 
approval statement on their publications. Once approved, CE providers are 
held responsible for continued compliance with those same standards to 
maintain recognition.   
PACE does not approve specific courses or credit hours Recognized Providers 
offer, but does review course materials as part of the provider application 
process, and maintains oversight over courses that bear the PACE logo.   
Any individual or entity may apply for PACE approval. Applicants pay an initial 
fee which includes the non-refundable application fee and first year’s 
recognition fee (which is refunded if recognized status is not awarded), register 
courses at no charge, and pay a modest attendee records fee.   
A registry of CE credits for attendees to PACE recognized courses is maintained 
in the FCLB CIN-BAD database as a service to both attendees and member 
boards.   
 
PACE Authority 
Individual regulatory boards retain the ultimate authority over continuing 
education content and approval for relicensure. 
Within the PACE program, the FCLB Board of Directors, as elected by member 
licensing boards, grants final approval and authority to all aspects of the 
program.  When making decisions, the FCLB Board considers recommendations 
of the PACE Committee as based on the investigative efforts of the Review 
Team.

Using This Book 
This booklet includes the two PACE governing documents, Policies & 
Procedures and Criteria for Quality Continuing Education.  The Policies 
explains the guiding principles and functions of the PACE program while the 
Criteria outlines provider compliance.  Both of these documents direct the 
work of the PACE Committee and Review Team. 
As the fundamental guidelines for the PACE program, these are officially 
adopted documents which cannot be changed without significant stakeholder 
participation.  Standard revisions require a 13 month deliberation and review 
process.  Emergency revisions must be approved by all current Recognized 
Providers.  Specific guidelines for revising the governing documents are 
outlined in Policy 5 – Amending PACE Governing Documents. 
The quality control for continuing education programs centers on the FCLB 
PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing Education. These criteria are subject to 
regular review by the FCLB.   
The appendices of this booklet are frequently updated to reflect the most 
current 
information 
about 
the 
PACE 
program 
and 
include 
sample 
documents, stakeholder information, frequently asked questions, and 
a history of the program’s development.

1. 
PACE’S MISSION 
 
“PACE” is the Providers of Approved Continuing Education program, a service of the 
Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards. PACE’s mission is to establish criteria 
and procedures for multi-jurisdictional recognition of continuing education 
providers, thereby: 
 
A. 
Furnishing doctors of chiropractic with a dependable basis for selecting 
continuing education programs, 
 
B. 
Assisting FCLB member boards in their evaluation of continuing education 
providers and programs,  
 
C. 
Improving the quality of continuing education programs through critical 
scrutiny and provider self-evaluation, and 
 
D. 
Protecting the public through advancements in chiropractic education. 
 
 
2. 
GOVERNANCE OF PACE 
 
Final authority over PACE is vested in the Board of Directors of the FCLB. The Board 
reserves the right to modify PACE as necessary to achieve the program’s objectives. 
 
 
3. 
LIMIT OF PACE’S AUTHORITY 
 
FCLB member boards are encouraged to incorporate PACE into their regulatory 
protocols; however, legal authority to accredit providers and programs remains with 
each member and is not assumed by PACE. 
 
PACE does not approve individual continuing education courses or award credit 
hours for course participation. PACE’s authority is limited to granting the status of 
“PACE Recognized Provider” to an applicant that demonstrates compliance with 
PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing Education and PACE Policies & Procedures.

FCLB PACE Policies & Procedures  
 
page 2 
 
4. 
VOLUNTARY NATURE OF PACE 
 
A continuing education provider’s participation in PACE is voluntary, but receiving 
PACE recognition obligates a provider to comply with PACE Policies & Procedures 
and PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing Education. 
 
 
5. 
AMENDING PACE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS 
 
Under ordinary circumstances, a proposed amendment to either PACE Criteria for 
Quality Continuing Education or PACE Policies & Procedures shall be submitted to 
the FCLB Board of Directors, which shall publish the proposal at least 30 days before 
the FCLB’s next annual meeting, invite written comment and provide a forum for 
discussion at the meeting. At the following year’s annual meeting, the FCLB Board of 
Directors shall vote to adopt or reject the proposed amendment. 
 
In the event of an emergency, the Criteria and Policies & Procedures may be 
amended with the unanimous consent of all currently recognized providers and the 
consent of two-thirds of the FCLB  Board of Directors and two-thirds of the PACE 
Committee. 
 
 
6. 
ORGANIZATION OF PACE 
 
PACE has three structural components, the PACE Review Team, the PACE Committee 
and the Appellate Commission. 
 
PACE Review Team.  The PACE Review Team’s responsibilities are to assess 
applicants for Recognized Provider status, to conduct course reviews and to 
investigate allegations of non-compliance by recognized providers. The Review 
Team reports its findings and recommendations to the PACE Committee. 
 
The Review Team shall be appointed by the President of the FCLB with the approval 
of the FCLB Board of Directors and shall consist of no fewer than 12 persons. The 
composition of the Review Team shall be as follows: 
 
A. 
One representative from each college that is a member of the Association of 
Chiropractic Colleges, appointed from a slate of three nominees offered by the 
president of the college; 
 
B. 
Such experts as may be needed by the Review Team to discharge its 
responsibilities efficiently and effectively. 


--- Page 13 ---
FCLB PACE Policies & Procedures  
 
page 3 
 
The term of service for a Review Team member shall be set by the FCLB Board of 
Directors but shall not exceed three years, and no member may serve for more than 
three terms. Terms shall be staggered. The Review Team shall elect a chair. 
 
PACE Committee.  The PACE Committee’s responsibilities are to provide oversight 
to the Review Team, receive the Review Team’s reports and recommendations and 
make its own recommendations to the FCLB Board of Directors concerning final 
action on provider applications, renewals or sanctions. The Committee shall be 
composed of eight persons appointed by the President of the FCLB with the approval 
of the FCLB Board of Directors and in conformity with the following criteria:  
 
A. 
One Committee member shall be a current Director of the FCLB and shall serve 
as Committee Chair; 
 
B. 
Two Committee members shall either be currently serving on FCLB member 
boards or shall have served on member boards within five years preceding 
appointment; 
 
C. 
One Committee member shall be an employee or representative of an entity 
that currently provides chiropractic continuing education; 
 
D. 
One Committee member shall be the current executive director or head 
administrator of an FCLB member board; 
 
E. 
One Committee member, deemed the Public Member, shall not be a Doctor of 
Chiropractic or a student in a Doctor of Chiropractic program and shall not 
meet any of the requirements set forth above; 
 
F. 
One Committee member shall be the chair of the Pace Review Team; 
 
F. 
One Committee member, ex officio and non-voting, shall be an employee on 
the staff of the FCLB. 
 
The term of service for a PACE Committee member shall be set by the FCLB Board of 
Directors but shall not exceed three years, and no member shall serve for more than 
three terms. Terms shall be staggered. 
 
Appellate Commission. The Appellate Commission’s responsibilities are to hear and 
adjudicate appeals resulting from the denial of Recognized Provider status or from 
any adverse action taken against a provider by the FCLB. To preserve the 
Commission’s impartiality, no Commission member shall participate in any initial 
decision regarding a provider application, renewal application or proposed adverse 
action.  


--- Page 14 ---
FCLB PACE Policies & Procedures  
 
page 4 
 
The Commission shall be composed of three persons appointed by the President of 
the FCLB with the approval of the FCLB Board of Directors. At least two of the three 
Commission members shall be current members of the FCLB Board of Directors. The 
term of service shall be two years and begin in January so as to run congruently with 
other FCLB committee appointments.  
 
 
7. 
CONFIDENTIALITY 
 
Neither the FCLB nor PACE shall disclose any information regarding PACE-
Recognized Providers or applicants for recognition except the following: 
 
A. 
That an application for recognition has been received and is pending or that a 
provider has been recognized, including the date of recognition and the date 
recognition expires; 
 
B. 
Any information required to be disclosed by applicable law or duly-entered 
court order. 
 
 
 
8. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
 
If any decision or action proposed by PACE creates a conflict of interest for a member 
of the FCLB Board of Directors, the PACE Review Team, the PACE Committee or the 
Appellate Commission, that member shall promptly recuse himself from participating 
in the proposed decision or action. 
    
 
9. 
APPLYING FOR RECOGNITION 
 
Step 1. 
Initial Application 
 
Any continuing education provider seeking “PACE Recognized Provider” status shall 
complete and submit to the FCLB an Application for Recognition. Required 
supporting documentation, the application fee and the first year’s recognition fee 
shall be included with the application. The FCLB staff shall publish submission 
deadlines, which shall be not less than 60 days prior to the next scheduled meeting 
of the PACE Committee. The application fee is non-refundable. If the application is 
denied, the first year’s recognition fee shall be refunded. 
 
At any time while an application is pending, PACE reserves the right to seek 
additional information from any source it deems necessary to properly review the 
application. Such additional information may include, but is not limited to, the 


--- Page 15 ---
FCLB PACE Policies & Procedures  
 
page 5 
 
names, addresses and telephone numbers of continuing education course 
participants, course evaluation forms turned in by participants, on-site visits by PACE 
representatives, and observation of continuing education programs 
 
FCLB staff members shall review a submitted application for completeness. If any 
deficiencies are noted, the applicant shall be so informed within 30 days after receipt 
of the application and shall be given the option to supplement the application or 
proceed as filed. 
 
Step 2. 
Review of Application 
 
Following initial staff review, the application shall be forwarded to the PACE Review 
Team and assigned to a three-member panel randomly selected by FCLB computer 
from Review Team members who have no prima facie conflict of interest. The 
applicant shall have the option to disqualify one panel member, and if the applicant 
exercises this option, a substitute member shall be randomly selected by computer. 
No further substitutions shall be allowed unless a proposed panel member 
voluntarily recuses himself. The three-member panel shall assess the application for 
compliance with PACE requirements and report its findings and recommendations to 
the PACE Committee. 
 
Step 3.  
PACE Committee 
 
The PACE Committee may remand an application to the Review Team panel for the 
development of further information or may recommend to the FCLB Board of 
Directors that Recognized Provider status be granted, granted subject to conditions, 
or denied. 
 
Step 4.  
Final Action by FCLB 
 
The FCLB Board of Directors shall recognize an applicant as a PACE Provider, or 
grant conditional recognition, or deny recognition. The Board shall notify the 
applicant of its decision in writing within 15 days after the decision is made. If 
recognition is denied, the notice shall set forth the basis for denial. An applicant who 
has been denied recognition may petition the Board for reconsideration. 
 
If PACE Recognized Provider status is granted, the FCLB’s written notice shall 
include: 
 
A. 
The effective date of recognition; 
 
B. 
A Recognized Provider reference number; 


--- Page 16 ---
FCLB PACE Policies & Procedures  
 
page 6 
 
C. 
The text of the statement that must be used when announcing or publicizing 
PACE recognition; 
 
D. 
A summary of PACE Provider responsibilities and the procedures to be 
observed for documenting attendance at continuing education programs; 
 
E. 
A summary of the procedures governing renewal applications for continued 
recognition; 
 
F.  
If applicable, a summary of required or recommended improvements to the 
Recognized Provider’s continuing education program.  
 
 
10.  
TERMS OF PACE RECOGNITION; REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
The initial period of recognition shall not exceed one year. To renew PACE 
recognition, a provider shall reapply at least once every three years and may be 
required to reapply more frequently if the PACE Committee determines that the 
provider’s circumstances so warrant. 
 
A Recognized Provider shall submit annual reports to the PACE Committee 
demonstrating ongoing compliance with PACE requirements. If required by the 
Committee, a Recognized Provider shall also submit interim reports to demonstrate 
that any compliance problem has been solved. 
 
Unless instructed otherwise by the staff of the FCLB, a Recognized Provider’s annual 
recognition fee is payable thirty days in advance of the anniversary of initial 
recognition.  
 
 
11. 
PUBLICIZING PACE RECOGNITION; USE OF PACE LOGO 
 
The grant of PACE Recognized Provider status does not imply recognition of a 
provider’s parent organization, subsidiary, satellite, sister division or partner. No 
advertising or promotional materials inconsistent with this provision are permitted. 
 
Use of the name “PACE” and the PACE logo is subject to the intellectual property 
rights of the FCLB and shall conform to the following requirements: 
 
A. 
Printed declarations of Recognized Provider status shall take the form, 
“[Provider Name] is recognized by the PACE program of the Federation of 
Chiropractic Licensing Boards.” The PACE logo shall appear in conjunction 
with this declaration, and neither the logo nor the declaration shall dominate 
other portions of the text. 


--- Page 17 ---
FCLB PACE Policies & Procedures  
 
page 7 
 
B. 
The PACE logo shall be tastefully displayed and shall not be given greater 
prominence than the provider’s name. 
 
C. 
The PACE logo shall not be used on the provider’s letterhead or in any fashion 
that would imply an affiliation between the provider and PACE or the FCLB 
other than as a PACE Recognized Provider. 
 
D. 
The PACE logo shall not be published in conjunction with any statement or 
material that, in the judgment of the FCLB, tends to undermine the credibility of 
the FCLB or its programs.  
 
The FCLB shall maintain a directory of PACE Recognized Providers, which shall be 
available to the public. The FCLB may charge a reasonable fee for printed copies of 
the directory.  
  
 
12. 
RENEWAL OF RECOGNITION 
 
PACE shall publish a schedule of renewal application deadlines. Deadlines shall fall 
approximately three months prior to meetings of the PACE Committee. PACE shall 
inform each Recognized Provider of the procedures for renewal of recognition 
approximately six months prior to the date recognition expires. 
 
A provider seeking renewal of recognition shall complete and submit an Application 
for Renewal of Recognized Provider Status, along with the required fee, not later 
than the published deadline next preceding the date recognition expires. The 
provider may also be required to submit evidence demonstrating ongoing 
compliance with PACE Policies & Procedures and PACE Quality Criteria. 
 
The PACE Committee shall either review the application itself or, in its discretion, 
appoint a panel of the PACE Review Team to study the application and report to the 
Committee. After the application has been reviewed, the PACE Committee shall 
recommend to the FCLB Board of Directors that Recognized Provider status be 
renewed, renewed subject to conditions, or denied. 
 
 
13. 
COMPLAINTS AGAINST RECOGNIZED PROVIDERS 
 
Any party who is informed and believes that a PACE Recognized provider has 
violated PACE Policies & Procedures or PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing 
Education may file a written complaint to that effect with the PACE Committee. The 
Committee shall maintain the confidentiality of all complaints.

Investigation of violations. The PACE Committee shall investigate alleged violations 
of PACE requirements and shall establish procedures, consistent with due process, to 
give Recognized Providers, applicants for recognition and providers denied 
recognition a fair opportunity to answer and present a defense to any alleged 
violation. 
 
The Committee shall have the authority to request that a respondent supply such 
documents and other materials as the Committee deems useful in conducting its 
investigation. Refusal to honor the Committee’s request may be read against the 
respondent. 
 
The Committee shall attempt to resolve informally any issue, dispute or concern 
underlying an investigation. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the 
Committee shall serve the respondent with a written complaint reciting the specific 
provisions of PACE Policies & Procedures or PACE Quality Criteria alleged to have 
been violated. The respondent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to answer the 
charges. 
 
Once the response period has expired, the Committee, at its next regularly-scheduled 
meeting, shall hear the complaint, compile a record of the hearing and make written 
recommendations to the FCLB as to the proper adjudication of the charges.  This 
recommendation shall include findings of fact and any sanctions proposed by the 
Committee.

RECONSIDERATION & APPEAL OF ADVERSE ACTION 
 
Reconsideration. A party against whom the FCLB has imposed sanctions shall have 
the right to petition the FCLB for reconsideration of its adverse action. Such petition 
shall be in writing and state with specificity the grounds for seeking reconsideration. 
 
The issue raised by a petition for reconsideration shall be limited to whether the 
FCLB followed PACE procedural and substantive requirements in taking adverse 
action against the petitioner. No additions to the existing record shall be permitted.  
 
A petition for reconsideration shall be submitted via certified mail to the PACE 
Committee in care of the offices of the FCLB. No petition postmarked more than 30 
days after the date of the adverse action shall be accepted. A non-refundable 
reconsideration fee in guaranteed funds shall be included with the petition. 
 
The PACE Committee shall review the petition and make recommendation to the 
FCLB Board of Directors whether to grant or deny reconsideration. The denial of 
reconsideration is itself an adverse action and may be appealed.  
 
The failure to petition for reconsideration shall not preclude a party’s appeal of an 
adverse action.  
 
Appeal. A party adversely affected by a final action of the FCLB shall have the right of 
appeal to the Appellate Commission. Such an appeal shall conform to the procedures 
set forth in this section. 
 
The issues on appeal shall be confined to whether the FCLB’s action was supported 
by the evidence of record and whether the action conformed to PACE Policies & 
Procedures and PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing Education. 
 
 
Notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the offices of the FCLB 
via certified mail within 30 days after the date of the adverse action. A non-
refundable fee in the amount of $1,500.00 in guaranteed funds (cashier’s check or 
certified check) shall accompany the notice of appeal. 
 
The FCLB shall promptly provide the appellant with a receipt for the paid fee and a 
schedule for submission of briefs, supporting documentation and such other 
information as may be needed to perfect the appeal. 
 
Unless the appellant makes a timely written request for a hearing, the appeal will be 
adjudicated without oral argument on the record as submitted. If a hearing is 
requested, the appellant shall bear the costs of holding the hearing and shall pay to 
the FCLB a deposit in the amount estimated by the FCLB to cover such costs. After 


--- Page 20 ---
FCLB PACE Policies & Procedures  
 
page 10 
 
the hearing, the FCLB shall provide the appellant with an itemized statement of 
costs, and the appellant shall promptly pay any balance due. 
 
The Appellate Commission may affirm in whole or part the action of the FCLB, vacate 
the action of the FCLB and remand the matter to the PACE Committee for further 
consideration, or reverse in whole or part the action of the FCLB. The Appellate 
Commission’s shall render its written decision within a reasonable time and shall 
state the basis upon which the decision is made. The decision shall be served by 
certified mail upon the appellant and the FCLB Board of Directors.  
 
 
16. 
REGISTERING CE PROGRAMS; COMPLIANCE AUDITS 
 
Although a PACE Recognized Provider may offer a continuing education program 
that does not meet PACE standards, any continuing education program that displays 
the PACE logo or uses PACE provider recognition in its promotional materials shall 
be registered with the FCLB. The deadline for registration shall be 30 days prior to the 
first day of the program. 
 
The PACE Committee, in its discretion, may direct that one or more of its 
representatives attend a registered program for the purpose of auditing compliance 
with PACE requirements. After the program has concluded, any PACE representative 
in attendance shall disclose his identity to the provider’s on-site agent. The provider 
shall make timely reimbursement to PACE for any registration fee paid by its 
representative unless the representative elects to use his attendance to satisfy a 
personal license renewal obligation, in which case no reimbursement shall be due. 
 
Compliance reports filed with PACE by its representatives are confidential and  may 
serve as a basis for further investigation or the initiation of adverse action against a 
provider believed to be in violation of PACE requirements. 
 
 
17. 
OFF-SITE PROGRAM REVIEW 
 
Three-member panels of the PACE Review Team shall randomly review documentary 
components of registered continuing education programs for the purpose of 
monitoring compliance with PACE requirements. Such documentary or “paper” 
reviews may be conducted before or after a program is presented, and post-
presentation reviews may include course evaluations from program participants. 
 
If a Review Team panel identifies any compliance issue, the provider shall be given a 
reasonable opportunity to revise or correct the program. If the provider fails to 
remedy the problem to the satisfaction of the panel, the panel shall request that the 
provider remove the PACE logo from the program’s promotional materials and may 
initiate a formal complaint against the provider.

18. 
PARTICIPANT RECORDS 
 
Within 30 days after the conclusion of its registered continuing education program, a 
PACE Recognized Provider shall forward to the FCLB a complete list of program 
participants, a summary of participant evaluation surveys and the required records 
fee. The FCLB shall establish standardized procedures to facilitate timely and 
accurate reporting of program participation. 
 
The list of program participants shall include each participant’s name as it appears 
on his or her license, license numbers for all known jurisdictions, address of record, 
the name and date of the program and such additional information as may be 
necessary to ensure accurate posting on the CIN-BAD database. 
 
The FCLB shall post participant information on CIN-BAD and shall certify each 
licensee’s program attendance to the relevant regulatory board or boards. At a 
licensee’s request, and upon payment of the appropriate fee, attendance records may 
be forwarded to other parties as directed by the licensee. 
 
 
19. 
REPORTING SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES 
 
A substantive change in the circumstances of a PACE Recognized Provider is a 
change that affects the provider’s ability to comply with PACE requirements. 
Examples of substantive changes include, but are not limited to, change of 
ownership, legal status or control; change in a source of financial support; and 
change in educational method. 
 
When a Recognized Provider contemplates making a substantive change, the 
provider shall notify the PACE Committee in writing at least three months prior to the 
effective date of the change, describe the proposed change in detail, and
demonstrate that the change will not impair compliance with PACE requirements. 
 
 
The PACE Committee may request such additional information as it deems necessary 
to evaluate the provider’s ability to continue to meet PACE requirements in light of 
the proposed change. The provider’s failure to supply the information requested, or 
the submission of false or misleading information, shall be grounds for initiating 
adverse action. 
 
If the PACE Committee determines that the proposed change is likely to place the 
provider out of compliance with PACE requirements, the Committee may direct the 
PACE Review Team to re-evaluate the provider’s recognition status and make 
appropriate recommendations. 
 
If a Recognized Provider is unsure whether a proposed change is substantive, the 
provider may apply in writing to the FCLB for an advisory opinion.

by the administration of PACE may file a complaint with the FCLB. The complaint 
must be in writing and signed by the party. 
 
The FCLB shall investigate the complaint, consult as necessary with the PACE 
Committee, the Appellate Commission or the FCLB Board of Directors, and make a 
good faith effort to resolve the complaint. 
 
 
21.

recognition fee shall be made upon early termination of recognition, whether 
voluntary or involuntary. PACE fees are established by the FCLB Board of Directors.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
 
Bullet What is the FCLB? 
The Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards (FCLB) is a non-profit
association of government agencies that license and regulate doctors of 
chiropractic.  Established in 1926, FCLB works to protect the public and to serve 
member 
boards 
by 
promoting 
excellence 
in 
chiropractic 
regulation.
Membership includes regulatory boards in the United States, US Territories, 
Canada and Australia. 
 
  
 
Bullet What is PACE? 
Providers of Approved Continuing Education (PACE) is a service of FCLB.  
Providers of continuing education programs who wish to have courses of study 
accepted for CE credit toward license renewal may apply for recognition status 
with PACE.  PACE Recognized Providers agree to comply with the FCLB PACE 
Policies & Procedures and FCLB PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing 
Education. These two documents establish uniform requirements to assist 
regulatory boards in granting relicensure credit.  
Consistent with the FCLB’s mission to protect the public and serve member 
boards, PACE is a voluntary service to chiropractic regulation.  Designed to 
streamline continuing education approval, PACE lessens administrative 
burdens for both CE providers and regulatory boards while at the same time 
offering uniform criteria as a basis for CE approval.  As with all FCLB programs, 
chiropractic regulatory boards are represented and have the opportunity to 
participate in the development, implementation, and continued improvement of 
PACE. 
 
Bullet How does PACE work? 
Providers of continuing education may apply to PACE for recognition status.  
PACE does not approve individual courses or programs. 
If accepted, Recognized Providers may use the PACE logo only on their 
qualifying programs. A PACE Recognized Provider may not use the logo on a 
course or program that does not meet PACE standards.

PACE FAQ 
 
1.1.2 
PACE Recognized Providers’ qualifying courses of study are registered with 
FCLB and posted in a searchable database on the FCLB Web site.  
Credits earned by individual doctors in courses that meet PACE requirements 
are reported to restricted access portions of FCLB’s CIN-BAD database, which 
(among other features) maintains CE records to assist chiropractic regulatory 
boards and professionals.  FCLB then issues reports to member boards to help 
ensure compliance by doctors of chiropractic with relicensure requirements.  
Participating providers pay an initial application fee, an annual recognition fee, 
and a modest fee to maintain and report attendees’ records. 
 
Bullet Who has authority over PACE? 
Individual regulatory boards retain the ultimate authority over continuing
education content and approval for relicensure.   
 
Within the PACE program, the FCLB Board of Directors, as elected by member 
licensing boards, grants final approval and authority to all aspects of the 
program. 
 
When 
making 
decisions, 
the 
FCLB 
board 
considers 
the 
recommendations of the PACE Committee as based on the investigative efforts 
of the Review Team.

Bullet Is it mandatory for a CE provider to be recognized by 
PACE? 
No. Participation in PACE is voluntary.   
FCLB member chiropractic regulatory boards decide to accept or recognize 
PACE requirements within their jurisdictions and CE providers elect to apply for 
PACE Recognition.   
Chiropractic 
regulatory 
boards 
are 
legally 
responsible 
for

PACE FAQ 
 
1.1.4 
PACE is designed to assist FCLB member boards in the significant substantive 
and administrative responsibilities associated with reviewing and approving CE 
providers and their programs.   
FCLB recommends that chiropractic regulatory boards adopt the PACE 
requirements as meeting the continuing education requirements of the board. 
In addition, and to provide flexibility to the boards and to meet the unique 
needs of each jurisdiction, boards may approve individual CE programs 
determined to meet the board’s criteria and to be in the public interest. 
 
Bullet Can a program that is not offered by a PACE Provider 
ever get to use the logo? 
Yes. A program may partner with a PACE Recognized Provider and offer 
courses under its authority. This means the PACE Recognized Provider takes 
the responsibility for full compliance with PACE requirements.   
For example, a program on whiplash might be developed by a well-qualified 
instructor, who does not seek full PACE Recognition status. A postgraduate 
education department of a chiropractic college (if it has achieved recognized 
PACE status) might want to include this class in its array of offerings. The 
college would be responsible for ensuring that the program complied with 
PACE requirements. It would also be able to extend appropriate and qualifying 
administrative support as required by PACE, such as records retention.  
 
Bullet Who qualifies as a Recognized Provider? 
Any entity or individual may apply. The provider should have been offering 
continuing education programs for at least one year. Organizations, 
educational institutions, departments, units or private providers are just some 
of the categories that may qualify.   
Recognition will be extended to those who comply with the FCLB PACE Policies 
& Procedures and FCLB PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing Education. These 
include (but are not limited to) submitting and completing an initial application, 
substantiating compliance with PACE requirements, payment of required fees, 
registering programs and participants, and proper display of the recognition 
status (use of the PACE logo and/or approval language).  
 
Bullet How much does it cost? 
REGULATORY 
BOARDS  
FCLB member boards pay nothing to participate in the 
program. PACE reduces the regulatory board’s workload 
and standardizes approval criteria.  


--- Page 39 ---
 
PACE FAQ 
 
1.1.5 
Also, reports are generated for each FCLB member board to 
document CE credits for individual licensees. This reduces 
the financial burden of random audits of all practitioners by 
identifying those who may need to document legal 
compliance with renewal requirements.  
CE PROVIDERS  An initial, non-refundable application fee of $500 is 
assessed for for-profit providers to process the application 
and 
review 
the 
provider’s 
compliance 
with 
PACE 
requirements.  The annual recognition fee of $2,000 for for-
profit providers is also required upon application and is 
refunded if status is not awarded. 
 
Initial approval is for a maximum of one year. Subsequent 
reapproval may be granted for up to three years upon 
 
successful completion of reapplication,  
 
payment of a reapplication fee and required annual 
recognition fees, and  
 
demonstration of continued compliance with PACE.  
 
Following completion of the program, a records fee for 
each D.C. attendee of $1 per hour (maximum $10 per 
attendee per course) must be forwarded to FCLB along with 
a list of participants.  This fee supports the costs of 
maintaining this data in the FCLB CIN-BAD database.  Fees 
only apply to licensed D.C.s and are non-waivable.  
 
Bullet What is the application process? 
An applicant must submit the required fee and complete an online application 
which describes and documents how the provider will comply with the FCLB 
PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing Education. The application also includes 
such 
items 
as 
contact 
information, 
instructor 
vitae, 
administrative 
qualifications, confirmation of a needs assessment, previous program offerings, 
etc. The PACE Committee is charged with determining whether the provider is 
both willing and able to comply with the program requirements. 
The application is assigned to a Review Team of volunteer experts who study 
the material to determine whether compliance can be assured. The Team 
reports its findings to the PACE Committee, which may remand the application 
back for further information or it may recommend to the FCLB Board of 
Directors that recognized status be granted or not.

PACE FAQ 
 
1.1.6 
Bullet Is there an appeal process if the provider disagrees with 
a decision by the FCLB Board of Directors? 
Yes. PACE allows for both reconsideration and appeal. Please see the FCLB 
PACE Policies & Procedures for details. The Appellate Commission also handles 
appeals in cases where recognized status might be removed for non-
compliance. 
 
Bullet How are complaints about PACE Recognized Providers 
handled? 
The complaint process is outlined in the PACE Policies & Procedures. Signed 
complaints regarding non-compliance with PACE requirements are subject to 
formal review by the PACE Committee. The process ensures a uniform 
procedure and timely resolution. Complaints outside the domain of the PACE 
program (such as fee disputes) are not considered. 
 
Bullet How are PACE courses posted? 
Each course that qualifies for the use of the PACE logo must be registered with 
the FCLB in advance of the course being held. 
PACE uses an easy online system of posting courses.  PACE Recognized 
Providers simply log on, input basic information about each course, and post 
the course.  Information is replicable, allowing providers to quickly copy 
existing courses and make minor changes such as date or location. 
All posted courses are then made available in a publicly searchable database 
that includes links to register with the PACE Recognized Provider.

PACE History 
 
2.1.1 
 
 
HISTORY 
 
Licensing boards and continuing education providers in every profession struggle with 
making the process of approving providers and programs more efficient.  The 
chiropractic profession has been no exception.     
 
Following a year-long study which commenced in 1995, the FCLB CE Task Force 
offered a streamlined and uniform CE application for voluntary use by chiropractic 
regulatory boards. The form was enthusiastically embraced and adopted without 
dissent at the 1996 Annual Congress of the Federation. More than half the member 
boards have allowed programs to be submitted for board review on this “uniform CE 
form.”     
 
However, it was clear that designing uniform application materials did not completely 
solve the efficiency issue. In 1999, another CE committee was appointed by FCLB 
President Dr. David E. Brown. Committee members included Dr. Wayne Wolfson (FL) - 
Chair, Dr. Joseph Brimhall (UT), Dr. Richard Cole (TN), Dr. Laurel Cowie (NS), Dr. 
Lester Lamm (WSCC), Dr. Glenn Moldenhauer (ID), and Dr. Lawrence Gerstein (MO) - 
FCLB Liaison with CCE Task Force on Postgraduate Education and CE.   
 
The FCLB CE Task Force developed an in-depth survey tool which was widely 
disseminated in the United States, Canada and Australia among all the regulatory 
boards, chiropractic colleges, national professional associations, the Congress of 
Chiropractic State Associations, accrediting agencies, malpractice carriers, and 
program providers. The purpose of the tool was to assess whether the current system 
was meeting the needs of the various stakeholders, and whether they would favor a 
centralized approval system. The results were overwhelmingly positive, encouraging 
the FCLB to begin the work of drafting a design.   
 
The next step for the CE Task Force was to study the designs already in use in 
numerous other professions. The Task Force reviewed CE approval programs for 
social work, dentistry, pharmacy, long-term care, optometry, osteopathy, podiatry, 
and allopathic medicine. They then developed draft models and initiated ongoing 
dialogue with member boards at the fall regional and spring annual meetings.  College 
presidents and postgraduate deans reviewed the Task Force’s ideas at several 
meetings of the Association of Chiropractic Colleges.  Based on feedback from the 
various constituencies, the Task Force made significant revisions to the draft program.  
 
The committee membership underwent several changes, and the new CE 
Development Committee met in Denver in August 2002 to develop draft policies, 


--- Page 42 ---
 
PACE History 
 
2.1.2 
procedures and criteria.  After numerous improvements by committee members and 
the FCLB Board of Directors, the 6
th draft was widely circulated among the regulatory 
community and at the Federation’s fall regional meetings. The document was also 
formally presented to the American Chiropractic Association, Congress of Chiropractic 
State Associations, Canadian Federation of Chiropractic Regulatory Boards, and the 
Association of Chiropractic Colleges. In addition, it was posted on the FCLB’s Web 
site, and the FCLB Board undertook a broad personal and public outreach seeking 
appropriate modifications.   
 
In January 2003, the Board of Directors of the Council on Chiropractic Education 
endorsed the PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing Education as representing fair and 
reasonable standards by which participating postgraduate programs could be 
assessed.   
 
In April 2003, the FCLB Board of Directors unanimously approved the PACE Policies & 
Procedures and the PACE Criteria for Quality Continuing Education, paving the way 
for the program to begin.  Additional revisions were adopted in January 2004 
following input the Board received during the 2003 outreach forums. 
 
In January 2005, the FCLB convened the first meeting of the PACE Review Team in 
Scottsdale, Arizona.  Experts in postgraduate chiropractic education, nominated by 
college presidents, met and reviewed the PACE governing documents.  Further review 
took place when the Review Team was again convened during the FCLB Annual 
Congress in Montréal the following May.  The Review Team submitted a final draft to 
the Board of Directors for approval in December 2005.  The Board adopted the final 
document on February 9, 2006. 
 
As always, the FCLB stresses that PACE is designed as a partner program to augment 
and streamline the difficult task of regulatory approval for CE programs. The final 
authority for approving providers and programs that qualify for relicensure 
credit is, and will always be, the responsibility of the regulatory boards.   
 
In closing, the FCLB extends appreciation to the CE Development Committee for the 
significant self-sacrifice and dedication of each of its members. The FCLB also 
acknowledges the many contributions of the extended advisory team of program 
providers and board members, and especially chiropractic college presidents and 
postgraduate deans. Special thanks are due to the members of the PACE Review Team 
for their hard work and insight.   
 
Further, the FCLB recognizes legal counsel Dale Atkinson, Esq., of Atkinson & 
Atkinson for his wisdom and extensive experience with numerous other professions.  
Finally, thanks to Vance Kinlaw, Esq., of the North Carolina Board of Chiropractic 
Examiners for his extensive revisions and clarification of the final documents.

PACE Recommended Statute and Rule 
 
3.1.1 
 
In an effort to assist member boards in adapting their legal language to utilize the FCLB 
PACE program, the Federation has developed suggestions for boards to review with their 
legal counsel. It is hoped that most boards will be able to promulgate Rules without 
needing to make changes in the Statute. This suggested model allows boards to continue 
to approve providers or programs like they may do currently, while ALSO recognizing the 
PACE program. 
 
A complete Model Law as developed by the Federation of Associations of Regulatory 
Boards (FARB) is available through the FCLB offices, which includes the wording for the 
entire section on license renewal. 
 
RECOMMENDED STATUTE: 
 
Section ____. Renewal of Licenses. 
(A) Licensees shall be required to renew their licenses at the time and manner determined 
by the Board, including the form of application and payment of applicable renewal fee. 
Under no circumstance, however, shall the renewal period exceed ___ years. 
 
(B) As a requirement for licensure renewal, each licensee shall provide evidence 
satisfactory to the Board that such licensee has completed at least ___ hours of continuing 
education from programs or providers approved by the Board. 
(C) The Board, by rule, shall establish requirements for continuing education, including 
determination of acceptable program content. The Board shall adopt rules necessary to 
enforce the objectives and provisions of this section and the continued competence of 
licensees. 
 
 
RECOMMENDED RULE: 
 
Pursuant to Article ___ Section ____, a licensee must annually complete at least ___ hours 
of continuing education from programs or providers approved by the Board. Pursuant to 
the legislative authority granted to the board, the Board hereby recognizes the 
requirements adopted from time to time of the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing 
Boards Providers of Approved Continuing Education (FCLB PACE) as the requirements of 
the Board. The Board recognizes FCLB PACE Recognized Providers as satisfying the 
requirements of the Board for purposes of the licensure renewal process. The Board, 
however, reserves the approval authority for all programs based on furtherance of 
professional development and related areas, and in the interest of the public protection 
objectives of the Act.

Educational Objectives 
 
Chiropractors provide treatment to almost 
one-third of all car accident claimants in 
America and successfully manage the multi-
plicity of conditions that result from these 
crashes. The physician is required to know 
how to take a history, perform an examina-
tion, make a diagnosis, provide appropriate 
management strategies, and articulate 
his/her findings and conclusions to third-
party payers and attorneys. It is imperative 
that the managing physician be knowledge-
able regarding the types of injuries that re-
sult from automobile accidents and aware of 
the complexities involved in rehabilitating 
the injured patient. 
• 
You will learn to formulate appropriate docu-
mentation of motor vehicle accidents. 
• 
You will get 33 years of practical real-world 
treatment experience from Dr. Spencer that 
will be applicable to your own practice. 
• 
You will get the latest update in the medical-
chiropractic research related to MVAs. 
• 
You will get an overview of recent publica-
tions that support chiropractic in the manage-
ment of various types of musculoskeletal con-
ditions. 
• 
Most importantly, you will learn how to en-
hance the likelihood of a more positive out-
come with your patients.

Criterion 14.  Objectives 
Criterion 14
 
 
 
1. Educational goals and learning objectives must be appropriate for the credit 
hours allocated to the course.  Please attach a sample of educational goals and 
learning objectives for a course you provided. 
 
 
 
14.1 Example: 
PROGRAM: Physical Rehabilitation of the Spine – offered 1/15/08 in Weld, CA 
Attendees at this presentation will learn  
• how to differentially diagnose chronic, progressive low back pain. 
• numerous pathophysiological presentations of common low-back disorders, 
the understanding of which will provide the practicing chiropractor a basis for 
determining: the natural course of a disorder, underlying causality, various 
stages of progression and differentiating factors. 
• how to elicit and process relevant clinical information from presenting patients. 
• how to process, evaluate, and cluster patient information according to 
relevance, significance and relatedness and to construct a complete problem list 
from the available patient information and be able to assess each problem. 
• how to confirm or reject hypotheses with additional carefully selected and 
acquired pieces of patient information; to create diagnostic game plans and 
structure decision scenarios that are reasonable, orderly, precise, and 
considerate of cost-benefit-risk-time factors; and what additional data are 
needed and what further tests to order, bearing in mind the concept of 
imperfect information. 
 
 
 
 
 
(continued) 


--- Page 89 ---
PACE Sample Workbook 
 
page 17 
 
 
 
 
 
(continued) 
• specific diagnostic algorithms for chronic low back pain that are designed to 
increase the diagnostic accuracy of the practicing chiropractor; to solve patient 
presentations and confirm diagnoses rapidly, like the seasoned clinician who 
uses shortcuts, tangents, selected data subsets and high-yield tests. 
• how to develop a more intelligent approach to problem solving by knowing 
what disorders are most common and therefore most likely to be present, by 
knowing the various presentations of a single disease and by realizing that 
several diseases may coexist in one patient. 
• how to apply valid and reliable provocative orthopedic and neurologic 
examination procedures to facilitate the differentiation of 
neuromusculoskeletal disorders from organic disorders. 
• how to systematically eliminate from consideration first, the more potentially 
life/health-threatening disorder before progressing with a concluding a 
diagnosis. 
• how to accurately assess the validity and reliability of any one of the diagnostic 
possibilities for any given patient presentation. 
• methodologies for challenging diagnostic hypothesis as they relate to low-back 
pain presentations. 
 
 
Criterion 15.  Needs Assessment 
Criterion 15 
 
1. Briefly describe your methods of conducting needs assessments 
 
 
15.1  Note:  
Possible formats for needs assessments may be post-course evaluation forms for 
attendees, structured surveys of the profession, or a review of current literature. 
 
2. How frequently are needs assessments conducted?

Criterion 16.  Subject Matter 
Criterion 16 
 
1. Please provide an example of a course that is evidence-based, authority-based, 
and/or tradition-based. 
 
16.1    Note:  
For a course to be considered evidence-informed and patient-centered, it should 
(a) integrate individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical 
evidence; and (b) reflect thoughtful identification and compassionate use of 
individual patients' predicaments, rights, and preferences in making clinical 
decisions about their care.  
 
Where there is a conflict among the criteria that a course be “evidence-based, 
authority-based or tradition-based,” the evidence-informed criterion trumps 
authority, and the authority criterion trumps tradition. Authority-based courses
have the endorsement or approval of a recognized expert in the subject matter 
whose credentials and credibility are well-acknowledged. Tradition-based 
courses are based on content that has a long precedent of inclusion within 
mainstream chiropractic. 
Previous applicants have responded with a course listing and summary of 
objectives. Although such responses generally suffice, the PACE Committee may 
ask the Provider to demonstrate a more detailed compliance with the provisions 
of Criterion 16.

rehabilitation expert.  This course includes 8 hours of lecture and 4 hours on 
hands-on, instructor-directed work.  Three diverse methods are presented 
including the pros and cons of total versus partial immobilization 
 
 
 
Criterion 17.  Instructional Materials
