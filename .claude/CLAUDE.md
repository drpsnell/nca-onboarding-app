## NeuroCentric Approach (NCA) Overview

NCA is a clinical methodology developed by Dr. Snell for assessing and treating patients with neuro-musculo-skeletal disorders.

### The NCA Ecosystem

Three interconnected pillars:

**ASSESSMENT**
- Graded Neuro Exam (GNE)
- Patient History
- Physical Exam

**TREATMENT**
- Manual Techniques: Graded Nerve Treatment (GNT), Dermal Traction Method (DTM), Transverse Nerve Mobes (TNM), plus clinician's existing methods
- Exercise Approaches: Developmental, Complex movement, Nerve mobes, Joint focused, plus clinician's prior training

**CONDITIONS**
- Body Regions: Upper Quarter, Lower Quarter
- ICD-10 Codes: FixYourOwnBack (lumbar disc herniation), more coming on NCA Academy site
- Sports: Running, Strength athletes (Kabuki program), Cycling, etc.

### Clinical Reference: Red Flags

Red flags are signs/symptoms indicating possible serious pathology requiring urgent medical evaluation:

**Cauda Equina Syndrome (Emergency)**
- Saddle anesthesia (numbness in perineal region)
- Bladder dysfunction (retention or incontinence)
- Bowel incontinence
- Progressive bilateral leg weakness
- Sexual dysfunction (acute onset)

**Cancer/Tumor**
- History of cancer
- Unexplained weight loss (>10 lbs in 6 months)
- Age >50 or <20 with no clear mechanism
- Pain at rest or night pain that wakes from sleep
- Failure to improve with conservative treatment (4-6 weeks)

**Infection**
- Fever, chills, night sweats
- Recent bacterial infection (UTI, skin infection)
- IV drug use
- Immunosuppression (HIV, transplant, chronic steroids)
- Recent spinal procedure

**Fracture**
- Significant trauma (fall, MVA)
- Minor trauma in elderly or osteoporotic patient
- Prolonged corticosteroid use
- Age >70

**Vascular**
- Pulsatile abdominal mass (AAA)
- Atherosclerotic vascular disease history
- Pain not affected by movement or position

**Other Serious Pathology**
- Progressive neurological deficit
- Bilateral neurological symptoms
- Upper motor neuron signs (Babinski, clonus, hyperreflexia)
- Thoracic pain (higher risk of serious pathology than lumbar)

### Clinical Reference: Yellow Flags

Yellow flags are psychosocial risk factors for developing persistent/chronic back pain. Screen for these during patient history:

**Beliefs & Attitudes**
- Belief that pain is harmful or severely disabling
- Belief that all pain must be abolished before returning to activity
- Expectation of passive treatments rather than active participation
- Catastrophizing (expecting the worst)

**Behaviors**
- Fear-avoidance behavior and reduced activity levels
- Extended rest or "downtime"
- Reduced activity levels with significant withdrawal from daily activities
- Poor compliance with previous treatment recommendations
- Reliance on aids (braces, crutches) beyond expected timeframes

**Emotional Factors**
- Tendency toward low mood, depression, anxiety
- Social withdrawal and isolation
- Feeling useless or not needed

**Work & Compensation**
- History of extended time off work with previous back pain episodes
- Problems with claims, compensation, or time off work
- Job dissatisfaction or poor work relationships
- Belief that work is harmful or will cause further injury
- Lack of employer support or workplace modifications

**Social Factors**
- Lack of social support system
- Overprotective family reinforcing disability
- Socioeconomic disadvantage
