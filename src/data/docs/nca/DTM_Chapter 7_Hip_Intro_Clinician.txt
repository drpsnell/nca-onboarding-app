Apply treatment to improve mechanical interface of the involved neuro5. Re-test provocative movement6. Apply homecare and perform regularly until sensitivity to movement normalizesThis is another high pay off area! “Hip” pain often involves buttock, flank and groin regions. Appropriate evaluation of the femoroacetabular, pubic symphyseal and lumbar spine joint complexes is crucial. Especially consider any surgical scars in these areas which we have seen to be a frequent area of tethering of superficial neurology.Common DiagnosisTrochanteric bursitisSciaticaFemoral acetabular impingementAthletic pubalgiaGroin painPiriformis syndromeSacroiliac (SI) joint syndromeHip labrum tearMeralgia parestheticaTarget NeurologySuperior cluneal nervesIliohypogastric nerveSciatic nerveIlioinguinal nerveGenitofemoral nerveSaphenous nerveObturator nerveInferior cluneal nervesMedial cluneal nervesSubcostal nerves
