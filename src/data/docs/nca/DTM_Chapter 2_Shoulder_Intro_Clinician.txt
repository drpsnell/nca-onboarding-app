Apply treatment to improve mechanical interface of the involved neuro5. Re-test provocative movement6. Apply homecare and perform regularly until sensitivity to movement normalizesShoulder arthritis and rotator cuff tears are often a “garbage can” diagnoses that can give a person a notion that a linear process of “degeneration” is in place and the end result might need to be surgery. We frequently have major success in managing chronic shoulder pain with DTM and very quickly re-work those limiting thought processes. Given the mixed motor and sensory capacity of many of these nerves, be sure to evaluate motor function and rule out a nerve root compression using McKenzie protocols. From a functional perspective, we find value in assessing the scapulo-thoracic and thoracic vertebral articulations to assure that coordinated movement of the entire shoulder girdle is available.Common DiagnosisRotator cuff impingementRotator cuff tearLabral tear (glenohumeral)Acromioclavicular arthritisGlenohumeral arthritisThoracic outlet syndromeTarget NeurologySuprascapular nerveSupraclavicular nerveRadial nerveMedian nerveUlnar nervePosterior ramii nerves
