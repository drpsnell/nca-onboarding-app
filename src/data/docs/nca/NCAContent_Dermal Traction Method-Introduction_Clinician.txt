Pain of nerve origin is called neuropathic pain but that term has historically been reserved for larger neurological structures such as nerve roots and peripheral nerves. (IASP, 2021-https://www.iasp-pain.org/resources/terminology) Historically, clinical training to determine the presence of neuropathic pain has been focused on evaluating the patient for evidence of conduction problems...numbness, tingling , and weakness. More recent evidence reveals that nerves of all size may become mechanically sensitive if their blood supply is compromised (Kobayashi, 2003). The 2 most common mechanisms for this sensitization of a nerve are excessive compression and excessive tension. On occasion, localized inflammation of a nerve, perhaps owing to a an injured structure near the nerve, may contribute to neural sensitization (Kobayashi, 2010; Satkeviciute, 2018). An understanding of the blood supply to a nerve is helpful.

As in much of the rest of the body, blood vessels and nerves commonly share common pathway and in this case the nerves that sense the health of the nerve itself are known as the nervi nervorum. Those nerves as a class are known as C-fiber nociceptors and they also exhibit a stocking-like coating around the outer part of the nerve. When a nerve becomes mechanically sensitive, it is this nervi nervorum network that is reporting either a mechanical concern or an inflammatory concern in the nerve itself. When compression, traction, or inflammation of a nerve are sufficient enough, the flow of the products of the cell body that are destined to be delivered to the nerve terminal via the microtubule transport system in the nerve may be disrupted as well. These products may consist of neurotransmitters, ion channels and other ligands. If this axoplasmic flow is disrupted for sufficient time, animal models show that those cell products can be errantly deposited in the area of the mechanical of inflammatory event (Dilley, 2008). This results in a focal area of sensitivity on the nerve known as an ectopic point or an abnormal impulse generating point. Emerging theories suggest that these might be the "trigger points" that have been hypothesized to be of muscle origin since Janet Travell, MD coined that term in 1942 (Quintner, 2015).Most physical medicine and rehabilitation targets so-called mesodermal structures (bone, joint, muscle, tendon, ligament) and considers painful movement to be reflective of inflammatory mediated nociception. Historically, the health of the local neurology itself has not been a focus of practice. In the way that McKenzie allowed a reconception of spinal nerve root interface, and Alf Brieg, David Butler and Michael Shacklock advanced our understanding of peripheral nerve neurodynamics, DTM considers the neurodynamics of the superficial and cutaneous nerves. HOW TO APPLY DTMIdentify a painful movementConsider the spinal, peripheral and superficial neurology servicing that areaBegin at the spine and rule in/out nerve root involvement. Re-assess the painful movementMove to the peripheral nerves and rule in/out involvement of those peripheral nerves. Re-assess the painful movementConsider local superficial nerves and lift to create space around those nerves while performing the painful movement. Re-assess the painful movementIf successful, show the patient how to create space around the painful nerves while movingPerform several times daily and before activity until the pain associated with the movement is goneAddress possible functional causes for the original injury and/or painRemember that everything is not associated with neuropathic pain. Before beginning the DTM process to address pain, see your doctor. If the DTM process is not fully addressing your condition, seek help from a healthcare professional to address other tissues that may be involved, such a tendons, muscles, ligaments, discs, etc.WHO DEVELOPED DTM?

The tests for motor strength and sensory discrimination help the clinician to identify problems of conduction in the nervous system. One of the early pioneers in neurodynamics, the study of the movement of nerves relative to their other structures in their environment, was Alf Brieg, MD. A spine surgeon by training, he theorized that the spinal cord and nerve roots had a requisite amount of excursion with normal body movements and that those excursions were reduced in spine pathology (Brieg, 1978). Brieg's ideas were appreciated by a group of physiotherapists from Australia who began to advance the concepts of neural mechanics and how to influence those mechanics using manual methods. Those influential clinicians included, Robert Elvey, PT; David Butler, PT; and Michael Shacklock, PT. (Butler, 2000; Shacklock, 2005) INCLUDEPICTURE "https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/127085/images/fc7/bdf/34d/Screen_Shot_2021-09-26_at_6.38.57_AM.png" \* MERGEFORMATINET Traditional clinical education in musculoskeletal care includes the Integrated Myofascial Trigger Point Hypothesis, first described by Janet Travell, MD in 1942 and expanded upon later by David Simons, MD. This hypothesis seeks to explain the observed clinical phenomenon of tight, painful bands and areas of localized contraction in muscles. The hypothesis held that these observed phenomena were due to a local energy crisis in the affected muscle from prolonged contraction of muscle spindles. This hypothesis historically suffered from circular reasoning which failed to explain the mechanism of onset of this prolonged contraction in the muscle. As most clinicians have observed, these contractions are not typically preceded by frank injury to the muscle. For many years, tissue assays of myofascial trigger points (MFTPs) failed to identify any change in the morphology. Then, in 2008, Jay Shah, MD at the NIH used needle dialysis of active vs latent MFTPs and found that active trigger points exhibited high concentrations of several inflammatory cytokines (Shah, 2008). Further, Dr. Shah found that once the MFTPs were deactivated via dry needling, the concentration of those cytokines was markedly decreased. This appeared to be a watershed moment in the objective proof of MFTPs.

In this process, the threatened afferent nerve produces an antidromic reflex which causes a local release of the same inflammatory cytokines Dr. Jay Shah had studied with MFTPs. Over time, this has resulted in a shifting of the MFTP hypothesis to see the observed palpable phenomena as mechanical interface dysfunction of neurology. Nerves not mechanically interfacing well with the tissues they course through, cause local painful inflammation and the surrounding muscle fibers tighten to protect the nerve...an alternative etiology for MFTPs.With DTM, we embrace this mechanical interface dysfunction hypothesis and utilize manual therapy consisting primarily of "openers" to help improve perfusion of these putative nerves.

They are individual to the patient and need not be very specific. Simply follow the principles of 1. Creating space around a painful nerve, 2. move the involved area in a way to “floss” the nerve painlessly through the tissues, 3. reperform the previously painful movement to normalize the body’s perception of the area with movement. The goal is to return the person to their desired activity without pain.HOW DOES “FUNCTIONAL REHAB EXERCISE” FIGURE INTO THE DTM PROCESS?The principles of functional movement assessment in rehab, suggests that pathomechanical movements may lead to tissue overload and subsequent injury. If a clinician is so inclined to include DTM and functional assessment into practice the goal is to use DTM to quickly allow the person to perform previously painful movements. The functional assessment may offer clues to movement patterns that may have resulted in tissue overload. Performance of those corrective exercises may theoretically reduce likelihood of injury or pain recurrence.  The common statement “First move well, then move often” echoed in the FMS system might be applied here.DOES DTM FIX EVERYTHING?Of course not! Pain may be an indication of serious injury or organ pathology. For that reason, we suggest that a doctor evaluate anyone for presence of those serious pathologies prior to investigating with the DTM process. Once those items are ruled out, then using the DTM process to quickly and inexpensively assess the status of the neurology in the area of the pain may offer a very quick and easy intervention the patient can take part in.CAN ANYONE APPLY THE DTM PROCESS?Painful conditions should FIRST BE ASSESSED BY A DOCTOR TO RULE OUT SERIOUS PATHOLOGY!! Once that has been done, we encourage people without healthcare training to use the DTM process under the guidance of your healthcare professional (massage therapist, coach, personal trainer, acupuncturist).
