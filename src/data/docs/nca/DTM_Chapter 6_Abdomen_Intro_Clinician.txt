
REMEMBER THE DTM FLOW…1. Identify provocative movement2. Consider involved neurology for potential neuropathic component3. Assess for neural sensitivity4. Apply treatment to improve mechanical interface of the involved neuro5. Re-test provocative movement6. Apply homecare and perform regularly until sensitivity to movement normalizesPain of visceral origin, particularly from appendicitis, inguinal hernia and kidney stones must be considered and ruled out here. We have found that in our patients that have had abdominal surgery (appendectomy, Caesarean section, laparoscopy, hernia repair, hip surgery), putative tethering of the superficial neurology in the surgical scar is a frequent cause of unexplained chronic pain in these areas.Common DiagnosisSports herniaInguinal herniaAthletic pubalgiaCostochondritisTietze’s syndromeTarget NeurologyAnterior cutaneous branches of intercostal nervesLateral cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves
