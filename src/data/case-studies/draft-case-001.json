    "hpiNarrative": "Mr. Thompson is a 42-year-old accountant who presents with right-sided low back pain that began 3 weeks ago after helping a friend move furniture. He describes lifting a heavy dresser with a rounded back when he felt a 'pop' in his lower back followed by immediate sharp pain. Initially the pain was localized to his low back, but over the following week it began radiating down the posterior aspect of his right thigh to just above the knee. The pain is worse with sitting, forward bending, and first thing in the morning. He reports the pain improves somewhat when walking and when lying on his left side with a pillow between his knees. He rates the pain 7/10 at worst and describes it as a deep ache with occasional sharp shooting sensations down the leg. He denies bowel or bladder changes, saddle anesthesia, or bilateral leg symptoms. He has been taking ibuprofen 600mg TID with minimal relief.",

        "Patient narrative example: 'The disc between your vertebrae is like a jelly donut. When you bent forward with that heavy dresser, the jelly got pushed toward the back where the nerve lives. That's why bending forward hurts and makes your leg symptoms worse.'",
        "'The good news is we can use extension exercises to push the jelly back toward the center. Your body is already trying to protect itself - those tight back muscles are guarding the irritated nerve. That's actually helpful right now.'",

      ],
      "teachingPoint": "The patient needs a mental model for WHY the exercises work. The 'jelly donut' analogy helps them understand disc mechanics intuitively.
